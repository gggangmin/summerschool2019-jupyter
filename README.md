# Summer School 2019
# Gravitational wave analysis with Jupyter-notebook 

This summer school project aimed at getting us familiarised on how to use jupyter notebook.

References and materials:

We mostly based our studies around this project :
https://github.com/minrk/ligo-binder
It is a tutorial on how the LIGO team analysed their data to find evidences of gravitational events. 

Here are some interesting link we used :

**The Gravitational Wave Open Science Center**
Where most of out ressources were found.
https://www.gw-openscience.org/start/
It is a website dedicated to help get citizen started in gravitational wave studies.
It provides data of events and tutorials on how to analyse them.

**gwosc**
It is a set of tool to fetch data and analyse gravitational events.
Which can be installed :
```sh
python -m pip install "gwosc"
```
