# Summer School 2019
# Gravitational wave analysis with Jupyter-notebook 

Our summer school project aims to familiarize us with good quality software for scientific projects that follows FAIR & RARE principles. <br>

We are working on the scientific software used for the detection of gravitational waves by various scientific teams at various labs.<br>



**References and materials:**

We mostly based our studies around this project : <br>
https://github.com/minrk/ligo-binder <br>
It is a tutorial on how the LIGO team analysed their data to find evidences of gravitational events.

Here are some interesting link we used :

**The Gravitational Wave Open Science Center**

Where most of out ressources were found.<br>
https://www.gw-openscience.org/start/<br>
It is a website dedicated to help get citizen started in gravitational wave studies.
It provides data of events and tutorials on how to analyse them.

**Anaconda** 

We highly recommend to use Anaconda in order to get a stable environement for Jupyter-Notebook  <br>
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

**gwosc**

It is a set of tool to fetch data and analyse gravitational events.
It can be installed using your python :

```sh
python -m pip install "gwosc"
```

To get used to **gwosc** we followed the tutorials at : <br>
https://github.com/gw-odw


**GWpy"

GWpy is a python package that is a collection of tool that are generally used to study data from gravitational wave detectors. <br>

The package is easy to use and well documented.<br>

The official documentation for GWpy can be found at https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/.
